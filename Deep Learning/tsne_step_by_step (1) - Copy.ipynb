    "# t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to applying t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on a dataset. We'll cover each step with explanations, code, and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: What is t-SNE?\n",
    "\n",
    "t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique primarily used for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. Unlike PCA or LDA, t-SNE is particularly good at preserving the local structure of data, making it very effective for visualizing clusters or patterns in complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE converts the similarities between data points into joint probabilities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of the low-dimensional embedding and the high-dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Importing Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing the necessary libraries for this analysis, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.\n"
