    "## History of DenseNet\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet, short for Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, was introduced by Gao Huang, Zhuang Liu, Laurens van der Maaten, and Kilian Q. Weinberger in their 2017 paper \"Densely Connected Convolutional Networks.\" The DenseNet architecture was designed to improve information flow between layers in deep neural networks by directly connecting each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation of DenseNet is the dense connectivity pattern, where each layer receives input from all previous layers and passes its own feature maps to all subsequent layers. This allows DenseNet to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, encourage feature reuse, and make the network more parameter-efficient.\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of DenseNet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet's architecture is characterized by dense blocks, where each layer is connected to every other layer within the block. This results in an \\(L(L+1)/2\\) direct connections in an L-layer network, promoting feature reuse and improving gradient flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical DenseNet consists of:\n",
    "- **Dense Blocks**: Composed of multiple layers, each layer takes as input the feature maps of all preceding layers.\n",
    "- **Transition Layers**: These layers connect dense blocks, performing downsampling via pooling operations and reducing the number of feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall architecture of DenseNet can be summarized as a series of dense blocks, connected by transition layers, followed by global average pooling and a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function to produce class probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dense Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "The connectivity pattern in DenseNet can be mathematically expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "x_l = H_l([x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{l-1}])\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(x_l\\) is the output of the \\(l\\)th layer, and \\([x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{l-1}]\\) represents the concatenation of the feature maps produced by layers \\(0\\) to \\(l-1\\). \\(H_l\\) is a composite function of operations such as batch normalization, ReLU, and convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet uses the cross-entropy loss for classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Loss} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(y_i\\) is the true label and \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is the predicted probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ReLU Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet uses the ReLU activation function, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{ReLU}(x) = \\max(0, x)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex patterns.\n"
