    "\n",
    "U-Net was introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in their 2015 paper \"U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation.\" The U-Net architecture was designed specifically for medical image segmentation, where the goal is to label each pixel in an image with a corresponding class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation of U-Net is its \"U-shaped\" architecture, which consists of a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder). This design allows the network to capture context and spatial information at multiple scales, making it highly effective for segmentation tasks.\n"

    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "U-Net's architecture can be divided into two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contracting Path (Encoder)**: The encoder is a typical convolutional neural network that applies convolutional layers followed by max pooling to reduce the spatial dimensions and capture high-level features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expansive Path (Decoder)**: The decoder upsamples the feature maps and applies transposed convolutions to increase the spatial dimensions. The key feature of the U-Net decoder is the use of skip connections that concatenate the corresponding feature maps from the encoder with the upsampled feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skip Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip connections are crucial in U-Net, as they allow the network to combine the high-level features from the encoder with the spatial information from the decoder.\n"
