    "## History of WaveNet\n",
    "\n",
    "WaveNet was introduced by DeepMind in 2016 in the paper \"WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio.\" WaveNet represented a significant breakthrough in the field of audio generation, as it was the first model to generate raw audio waveforms directly. Unlike traditional methods that rely on spectrograms or hand-engineered features, WaveNet models the waveform as a probabilistic sequence, allowing it to generate highly realistic and natural-sounding speech. It has since been applied to various tasks, includ...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of WaveNet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autoregressive Model\n",
    "\n",
    "WaveNet is an autoregressive model that generates audio waveforms sample by sample. Given a sequence of previous samples \\( x_{1:t-1} \\), the model predicts the next sample \\( x_t \\) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "p(x_t | x_{1:t-1}) = \\text{softmax}(f(x_{1:t-1}))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( f \\) is a deep neural network, and the output is a probability distribution over the possible values of the next sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dilated Causal Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions to model long-range dependencies in the audio waveform. A dilated convolution is a convolution where the filter is applied over a larger input area, allowing the network to cover a wider range of input values without increasing the number of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dilation factor \\( d \\) increases exponentially with the depth of the network, allowing the receptive field to grow exponentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Output}[i] = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\text{Filter}[k] \\cdot \\text{Input}[i - d \\cdot k]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( K \\) is the size of the filter, and \\( d \\) is the dilation factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gated Activation Unit\n",
    "\n",
    "WaveNet uses gated activation units to improve the model's ability to capture complex dependencies in the audio waveform. The gated activation unit is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "z = \\tanh(W_{f,k} \\ast x + V_{f,k} \\ast h) \\odot \\sigma(W_{g,k} \\ast x + V_{g,k} \\ast h)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( W_{f,k} \\) and \\( W_{g,k} \\) are the weights for the filter and gate, respectively.\n",
    "- \\( \\ast \\) denotes convolution.\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "- \\( \\odot \\) represents element-wise multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residual and Skip Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "WaveNet employs residual and skip connections to allow gradients to flow more easily through the network, improving training efficiency and convergence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "h = x + z\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( h \\) is the output of the residual block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "WaveNet is trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the predicted samples, using backpropagation through time (BPTT) to update the network's weights. The model is trained on large datasets of raw audio, allowing it to learn the complex patterns and structures present in natural speech.\n"
