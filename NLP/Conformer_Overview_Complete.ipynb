    "The Conformer model was introduced by Google Research in 2020 in the paper \"Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition.\" The model was developed to improve the performance of speech recognition systems by combining the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers.

    "## Mathematical Foundation of Conformer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conformer Block\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conformer model is built upon the Conformer block, which integrates convolutional layers with multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks. This block is designed to capture both local and global dependencies in the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Conformer block consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feed-Forward Module**: The feed-forward module is a position-wise feed-forward network applied to each position of the input independently. It is followed by a residual connection and layer normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{FFN}(x) = \\text{LayerNorm}(x + \\text{Dropout}(\\text{ReLU}(W_2(\\text{Dropout}(\\text{ReLU}(W_1(x)))))))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\) are weight matrices, and ReLU is the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing global dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Concat}(\\text{head}_1, \\dots, \\text{head}_h)W^O\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each attention head is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{head}_i = \\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convolution Module**: The convolution module captures local dependencies by applying a depthwise separable convolution followed by batch normalization and the Swish activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Conv}(x) = \\text{BatchNorm}(\\text{DepthwiseConv}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feed-Forward Module (Revisited)**: Another feed-forward module is applied after the convolution module to further refine the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Layer Normalization**: The output of the Conformer block is passed through a final layer normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Conformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conformer model stacks multiple Conformer blocks, allowing it to capture complex patterns in the input sequence. The architecture is particularly well-suited for speech recognition tasks, as it effectively handles both short-term and long-term dependencies in the audio data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Conformer}(x) = \\text{Stack}(\\text{ConformerBlock}_1, \\dots, \\text{ConformerBlock}_N)(x)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conformer model is typically trained using the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss for ASR tasks. The CTC loss allows the model to predict sequences of varying lengths without the need for explicit alignment between the input and output sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CTC}} = -\\log p(y | x)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(y\\) is the target transcription and \\(x\\) is the input speech sequence.\n"
