    "\n",
    "DistilBERT was introduced by the Hugging Face team in 2019 as part of their efforts to create smaller, faster, and more efficient versions of the popular BERT model. The work is detailed in the paper \"DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter.\" DistilBERT is a distilled version of BERT, meaning it retains much of BERT's performance while being significantly smaller and faster, making it more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. It achieves this...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of DistilBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT is based on the concept of knowledge distillation, where a smaller \"student\" model is trained to replicate the behavior of a larger \"teacher\" model (in this case, BERT). The student model is trained to mimic the outputs of the teacher model, including the logits and hidden states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a large teacher model \\( T \\) and a smaller student model \\( S \\), the knowledge distillation loss is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{distill}} = \\lambda_1 \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}}(S(x), y) + \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}}(S(x) || T(x)) + \\lambda_3 \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cosine}}(S(x), T(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}} \\) is the cross-entropy loss between the student model's predictions and the ground truth labels.\n",
    "- \\( \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}} \\) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the student and teacher models' output distributions.\n",
    "- \\( \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cosine}} \\) is the cosine embedding loss between the student and teacher models' hidden states.\n",
    "- \\( \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3 \\) are weights that balance the three components of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reduction in Model Size\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT reduces the size of the BERT model by:\n",
    "1. **Reducing the number of layers**: DistilBERT has 6 layers instead of 12 in BERT-Base.\n",
    "2. **Removing the token-type embeddings**: DistilBERT removes the token-type (segment) embeddings, simplifying the model.\n",
    "3. **Using a smaller hidden size**: The hidden size in DistilBERT is reduced compared to BERT, further decreasing the model's size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT is pre-trained using the same masked language modeling (MLM) objective as BERT, but with the added loss functions for knowledge distillation. The student model is trained to approximate the teacher model's behavior while being smaller and more efficient.\n"
