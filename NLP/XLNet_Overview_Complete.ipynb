    "\n",
    "XLNet was introduced by Zhilin Yang et al. from Google AI Brain and Carnegie Mellon University in 2019 in the paper \"XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding.\" XLNet was developed as an alternative to BERT, combining the strengths of autoregressive models like GPT with the bidirectional context learning of BERT. By using a permutation-based training objective, XLNet is able to capture bidirectional contexts without the limitations of masked language models. It outperforme...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of XLNet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permutation Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation of XLNet is its permutation language modeling objective. Instead of using a fixed left-to-right or right-to-left order like traditional autoregressive models, XLNet considers all possible permutations of the input sequence, allowing the model to capture bidirectional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of tokens \\(x = [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T]\\), XLNet defines a factorization order \\(z\\) as a permutation of the sequence indices. The objective is to maximize the log-likelihood of the sequence under different permutations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{z \\in Z_T} \\log p(x_{z_t} | x_{z_{<t}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(z_t\\) is the \\(t\\)-th element in the permutation \\(z\\), and \\(Z_T\\) is the set of all possible permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer-XL Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "XLNet builds upon the Transformer-XL architecture, which incorporates recurrence mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-XL allows XLNet to model longer sequences by reusing hidden states from previous segments, leading to more efficient learning of long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "h_t^{\\text{XLNet}} = \\text{Transformer-XL}(x_t, h_{t-1})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(h_t^{\\text{XLNet}}\\) represents the hidden state at time step \\(t\\), and \\(h_{t-1}\\) is the hidden state from the previous segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Stream Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "XLNet introduces a two-stream self-attention mechanism, which consists of content and query streams. The content stream processes the content of the tokens, while the query stream generates the predictions. This allows the model to predict the tokens in any order without seeing the actual token.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Attention} = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(Q\\) is the query matrix from the query stream.\n",
    "- \\(K\\) and \\(V\\) are the key and value matrices from the content stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "XLNet is pre-trained using the permutation language modeling objective and fine-tuned on downstream tasks like text classification, question answering, and natural language inference. The model leverages large-scale datasets and powerful computational resources to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various NLP benchmarks.\n"
