    "\n",
    "RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) was introduced by Facebook AI in 2019 in the paper \"RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach.\" RoBERTa is a variant of BERT, designed to address some of the limitations of the original BERT model. By making adjustments to the pre-training process, such as training on more data, removing the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task, and using larger batch sizes and learning rates, RoBERTa achieved improved performance on various NLP benchmar...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of RoBERTa-Base\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Like BERT, RoBERTa is based on the Transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences. The core component of RoBERTa is the transformer encoder, consisting of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Self-Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(Q\\) is the query matrix, \\(K\\) is the key matrix, and \\(V\\) is the value matrix, all derived from the input embeddings.\n",
    "- \\(d_k\\) is the dimensionality of the key vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "RoBERTa made several key changes to the BERT pre-training process:\n",
    "1. **Larger Batch Sizes and Learning Rates**: RoBERTa uses larger batch sizes and learning rates to speed up convergence during training.\n",
    "2. **Training on More Data**: RoBERTa is trained on a significantly larger dataset compared to BERT, utilizing more diverse and extensive text corpora.\n",
    "3. **Removal of NSP Task**: The Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task is removed in RoBERTa, as experiments showed that it did not contribute to improved performance.\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Masking**: Instead of using a fixed masking pattern, RoBERTa applies dynamic masking during each epoch, ensuring that the model sees different masked tokens during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Masked Language Modeling (MLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "RoBERTa, like BERT, uses Masked Language Modeling (MLM) as its primary pre-training objective. In MLM, random words in a sentence are masked, and the model is trained to predict the original words based on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{MLM}} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log p(x_i | x_{i-k}, \\dots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \\dots, x_{i+k})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(x_i\\) is the masked token, and the model predicts it using the surrounding context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "RoBERTa-Base is pre-trained on a large text corpus using the MLM objective. The pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering.\n"
