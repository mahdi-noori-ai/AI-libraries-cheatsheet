    "## History of Transformer-XL\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer-XL was introduced by Zihang Dai et al. from Google AI in 2019 in the paper \"Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context.\" The model was developed to address the limitations of traditional transformer models, particularly their inability to capture long-range dependencies effectively. Transformer-XL extends the context length by introducing a recurrence mechanism that allows the model to reuse hidden states from previous segments, leading to improved performance on ...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of Transformer-XL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrence Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation of Transformer-XL is its recurrence mechanism, which allows the model to reuse hidden states from previous segments. This mechanism enables the model to capture long-range dependencies without the need for very deep architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of tokens \\(x = [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T]\\), Transformer-XL defines the hidden state at time step \\(t\\) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "h_t^{\\text{XL}} = \\text{Transformer}(x_t, h_{t-1}^{\\text{XL}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(h_{t-1}^{\\text{XL}}\\) is the hidden state from the previous segment. This recurrence mechanism allows the model to maintain a memory of past contexts, effectively extending the context length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segment-Level Recurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer-XL uses segment-level recurrence, where each segment of the input sequence is processed independently, but the hidden states from the previous segment are carried over to the current segment. This approach mitigates the issue of fixed-length context in traditional transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Segment } s_t = [h_{t-L}^{\\text{XL}}, \\dots, h_t^{\\text{XL}}]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(L\\) is the segment length, and the hidden states from the previous segment are concatenated with the current segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relative Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer-XL introduces relative positional encoding to improve the model's ability to generalize to longer sequences. Instead of using absolute positional encodings, the model uses relative distances between tokens, which allows it to better capture the relationships between tokens, regardless of their position in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Relative Position} = \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V + R)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(R\\) represents the relative positional encoding matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer-XL is trained using the autoregressive language modeling objective, where the model predicts the next token in the sequence based on the current and past contexts. The model is fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as text classification, language modeling, and machine translation.\n"
