    "## History of ALBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "ALBERT (A Lite BERT) was introduced by Google Research in 2019 in the paper \"ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations.\" ALBERT was developed to address some of the inefficiencies in BERT by reducing the model's size and improving training speed while maintaining high performance. The key innovations in ALBERT include parameter-sharing across layers and factorized embedding parameterization. These modifications allow ALBERT to scale more efficiently than BERT, making it...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of ALBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter-Sharing Across Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key innovations in ALBERT is parameter-sharing across layers. In traditional transformer models like BERT, each layer has its own set of parameters, leading to a significant increase in the number of parameters as the model depth increases. ALBERT reduces the number of parameters by sharing the same parameters across all layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an input sequence \\( x \\), the hidden state at layer \\( l \\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "h_l = \\text{TransformerLayer}(h_{l-1}; \\theta)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( \\theta \\) represents the shared parameters across all layers. This parameter-sharing mechanism significantly reduces the number of parameters in the model without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factorized Embedding Parameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "ALBERT also introduces factorized embedding parameterization, where the size of the hidden layers and the size of the vocabulary embeddings are decoupled. This allows the model to have smaller embedding matrices, reducing memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding matrix \\( E \\) is factorized into two smaller matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "E = E_1 \\cdot E_2\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( E_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|V| \\times d_e} \\) maps the vocabulary to a lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "- \\( E_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_e \\times d_h} \\) maps the lower-dimensional embeddings to the hidden space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inter-sentence Coherence Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "ALBERT replaces BERT's Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) task with an inter-sentence coherence loss, called the Sentence Order Prediction (SOP) task. The SOP task aims to predict the correct order of two consecutive segments, helping the model better understand the relationships between sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function for SOP is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{SOP}} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ y_i \\log p(y_i | x_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log (1 - p(y_i | x_i)) \\right]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_i \\) is the label indicating whether the order is correct or incorrect, and \\( x_i \\) is the input pair of segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "ALBERT is trained using the same masked language modeling (MLM) objective as BERT, but with the added SOP loss. The model is pre-trained on large text corpora and can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as text classification, natural language inference, and question answering.\n"
