    "## History of WaveNet-Vocoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The WaveNet-Vocoder is an application of the original WaveNet model, introduced by DeepMind in 2016, specifically for vocoding tasks. Vocoders are tools that convert spectral representations of audio (such as mel-spectrograms) into waveforms. WaveNet was initially proposed as a generative model for raw audio waveforms, but it quickly became evident that its capabilities could be leveraged as a vocoder. The WaveNet-Vocoder was further refined in subsequent research to improve efficiency and quality, making...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of WaveNet-Vocoder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autoregressive Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the original WaveNet, the WaveNet-Vocoder is an autoregressive model that generates audio samples one at a time based on previous samples. The probability of each sample \\(x_t\\) given the previous samples \\(x_{1:t-1}\\) and the conditioning input \\(h\\) (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) is modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "p(x_t | x_{1:t-1}, h) = \\text{softmax}(f(x_{1:t-1}, h))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(f\\) is a deep convolutional neural network with dilated causal convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditioning on Mel-Spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between WaveNet and WaveNet-Vocoder is that the latter is conditioned on features derived from the input audio, typically a mel-spectrogram. The conditioning is incorporated at each layer of the network, allowing the model to generate audio that matches the spectral characteristics of the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "y_t = \\text{WaveNet}(x_{1:t-1}, h)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(y_t\\) is the predicted sample and \\(h\\) is the mel-spectrogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dilated Causal Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "WaveNet-Vocoder employs dilated causal convolutions to model long-range dependencies in the audio signal. The dilation factor increases exponentially with the depth of the network, enabling the model to capture long-term patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Output}[i] = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\text{Filter}[k] \\cdot \\text{Input}[i - d \\cdot k]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(K\\) is the filter size, and \\(d\\) is the dilation factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Residual and Skip Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the original WaveNet, WaveNet-Vocoder uses residual and skip connections to facilitate gradient flow and improve model training:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "h = x + z\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\(h\\) is the output of the residual block, and \\(z\\) is the gated activation output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The training objective for WaveNet-Vocoder is to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the predicted samples, conditioned on the input mel-spectrogram. This is achieved using backpropagation through time (BPTT) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "\n",
