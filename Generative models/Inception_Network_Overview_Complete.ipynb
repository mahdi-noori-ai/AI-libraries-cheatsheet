    "## History of Inception Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Inception Networks, also known as GoogLeNet, were introduced by Christian Szegedy et al. in 2014 in the paper \"Going Deeper with Convolutions.\" The Inception architecture was designed to address the challenges of computational efficiency and model complexity in deep neural networks. The key innovation of the Inception module was the use of multiple filter sizes in parallel, allowing the network to capture features at different scales. Over time, the Inception architecture evolved, leading to subsequent v...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of Inception Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inception Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The core component of an Inception Network is the Inception module, which performs convolution operations with different filter sizes in parallel. This allows the network to capture features at multiple scales without significantly increasing the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallel Convolutions**: An Inception module applies multiple convolution operations with different filter sizes (e.g., 1x1, 3x3, 5x5) in parallel to the input feature map. It also includes a max-pooling operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Inception}(x) = [\\text{Conv}_{1 \\times 1}(x), \\text{Conv}_{3 \\times 3}(x), \\text{Conv}_{5 \\times 5}(x), \\text{MaxPool}(x)]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: To reduce the computational cost, 1x1 convolutions are often used before the larger convolutions (3x3, 5x5) to reduce the number of input channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Conv}_{1 \\times 1}(\\text{Conv}_{3 \\times 3}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concatenation**: The outputs of these parallel operations are concatenated along the channel dimension to form the output of the Inception module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Output} = \\text{Concat}([\\text{Conv}_{1 \\times 1}, \\text{Conv}_{3 \\times 3}, \\text{Conv}_{5 \\times 5}, \\text{MaxPool}])\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auxiliary Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Inception Networks also introduced the concept of auxiliary classifiers, which are added to the intermediate layers of the network. These classifiers provide additional gradient signals and help in regularizing the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{aux}} = \\text{CrossEntropy}(\\hat{y}_{\\text{aux}}, y)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( \\hat{y}_{\\text{aux}} \\) is the prediction from the auxiliary classifier and \\( y \\) is the true label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inception-v3 and Inception-v4\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent versions of the Inception architecture, such as Inception-v3 and Inception-v4, introduced further refinements, including the use of factorized convolutions (e.g., 3x3 convolution factorized into two 1x3 and 3x1 convolutions) and more complex Inception modules with additional branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Factorized Conv} = \\text{Conv}_{1 \\times 3}(\\text{Conv}_{3 \\times 1}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements improved the model's accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Inception Networks typically use the categorical cross-entropy loss function, especially for classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CCE}} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \\log(p_i)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_i \\) is the ground truth label, \\( p_i \\) is the predicted probability for class \\( i \\), and \\( C \\) is the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training an Inception Network involves minimizing the cross-entropy loss, including both the main classifier's loss and the auxiliary classifiers' losses. The network is trained using gradient descent with backpropagation.\n"
