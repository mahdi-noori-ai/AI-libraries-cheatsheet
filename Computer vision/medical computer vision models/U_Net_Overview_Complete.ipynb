    "## History of U-Net\n",
    "\n",
    "U-Net was introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox in 2015 in the paper \"U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation.\" U-Net was specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to identify the boundaries of structures within images. The model quickly gained popularity due to its ability to produce high-quality segmentations with limited training data, making it a standard architecture for segmentation tasks in various domains.\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of U-Net\n",
    "\n",
    "### U-Net Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The U-Net architecture consists of two main parts: the contracting path (encoder) and the expansive path (decoder).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contracting Path (Encoder)**: The encoder is a typical convolutional neural network that applies a series of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The purpose of the encoder is to capture the context of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{encoder}}(x) = \\text{Conv}_n(\\text{MaxPool}_{n-1}(...\\text{MaxPool}_1(\\text{Conv}_1(x))...))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each \\( \\text{Conv}_i \\) represents a convolutional layer followed by an activation function (typically ReLU), and \\( \\text{MaxPool}_i \\) represents a max-pooling operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bottleneck**: The bottleneck is the layer that connects the encoder to the decoder. It captures the most abstract representation of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{bottleneck}}(x) = \\text{Conv}_{\\text{bottleneck}}(\\text{MaxPool}_n(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expansive Path (Decoder)**: The decoder applies a series of up-convolutional layers (transposed convolutions) to upsample the feature maps and recover the spatial resolution of the input image. Skip connections are used to concatenate the corresponding feature maps from the encoder to the decoder, which helps preserve spatial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{decoder}}(x) = \\text{UpConv}_1(\\text{Concat}([f_{\\text{bottleneck}}(x), f_{\\text{encoder}}(x)]))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( \\text{UpConv}_i \\) represents an up-convolutional layer, and \\( \\text{Concat} \\) represents the concatenation operation along the channel axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Convolution**: The final convolutional layer produces the output segmentation map with the desired number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Output} = \\text{Conv}_{\\text{final}}(f_{\\text{decoder}}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For segmentation tasks, U-Net typically uses a pixel-wise loss function such as the binary cross-entropy loss or the Dice coefficient loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{BCE}} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ y_i \\log(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\log(1-p_i) \\right]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dice Coefficient Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Dice}} = 1 - \\frac{2 \\sum_i p_i y_i + \\epsilon}{\\sum_i p_i + \\sum_i y_i + \\epsilon}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_i \\) is the ground truth label, \\( p_i \\) is the predicted probability, and \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small constant to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a U-Net model involves minimizing the chosen loss function using backpropagation and gradient descent, updating the weights of the network to improve segmentation accuracy.\n"
