    "\n",
    "3D U-Net was introduced by Özgün Çiçek et al. in 2016 in the paper \"3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation.\" The 3D U-Net architecture is an extension of the original U-Net, specifically designed for volumetric data, such as 3D medical images. This model extends the 2D operations of U-Net into 3D, allowing it to effectively capture spatial context in all three dimensions, which is crucial for tasks like brain tumor segmentation, organ segmentation, and more.\n"

    "### 3D U-Net Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D U-Net architecture is an extension of the original U-Net, designed to handle 3D volumetric data. The main difference is that all operations are extended to three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **3D Convolution and Max-Pooling**: In 3D U-Net, the 2D convolutional and max-pooling layers are replaced with their 3D counterparts. This allows the network to learn features that capture spatial context across all three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{encoder}}(x) = \\text{Conv3D}_n(\\text{MaxPool3D}_{n-1}(...\\text{MaxPool3D}_1(\\text{Conv3D}_1(x))...))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each \\( \\text{Conv3D}_i \\) represents a 3D convolutional layer followed by a 3D activation function (typically ReLU), and \\( \\text{MaxPool3D}_i \\) represents a 3D max-pooling operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bottleneck**: The bottleneck layer captures the most abstract representation of the input volume, with a deep feature representation that is then passed to the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{bottleneck}}(x) = \\text{Conv3D}_{\\text{bottleneck}}(\\text{MaxPool3D}_n(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **3D Upsampling and Skip Connections**: Similar to the 2D U-Net, the 3D U-Net uses upsampling layers in the decoder to increase the spatial resolution of the feature maps. Skip connections are used to concatenate the corresponding feature maps from the encoder to the decoder, preserving spatial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{decoder}}(x) = \\text{UpConv3D}_1(\\text{Concat}([f_{\\text{bottleneck}}(x), f_{\\text{encoder}}(x)]))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( \\text{UpConv3D}_i \\) represents a 3D up-convolutional layer, and \\( \\text{Concat} \\) represents the concatenation operation along the channel axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Convolution**: The final convolutional layer produces the output segmentation map with the desired number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Output} = \\text{Conv3D}_{\\text{final}}(f_{\\text{decoder}}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For volumetric segmentation tasks, 3D U-Net typically uses a loss function such as the Dice coefficient loss or the binary cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dice Coefficient Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Dice}} = 1 - \\frac{2 \\sum_i p_i y_i + \\epsilon}{\\sum_i p_i + \\sum_i y_i + \\epsilon}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{BCE}} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ y_i \\log(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\log(1-p_i) \\right]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_i \\) is the ground truth label, \\( p_i \\) is the predicted probability, and \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small constant to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a 3D U-Net model involves minimizing the chosen loss function using backpropagation and gradient descent. The model is trained to improve segmentation accuracy across all three dimensions, making it well-suited for volumetric data like 3D medical images.\n"
