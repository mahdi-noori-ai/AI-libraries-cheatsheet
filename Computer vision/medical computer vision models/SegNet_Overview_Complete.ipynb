    "\n",
    "SegNet was introduced by Vijay Badrinarayanan, Alex Kendall, and Roberto Cipolla in 2015 in the paper \"SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation.\" SegNet was designed to be an efficient and accurate model for pixel-wise segmentation, particularly for autonomous driving and other applications requiring real-time performance. The key innovation in SegNet is the use of pooling indices in the decoding process, which allows the model to perform upsampling without learn...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of SegNet\n",
    "\n",
    "### SegNet Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "SegNet follows an encoder-decoder architecture similar to U-Net, but with some key differences, particularly in the way it handles upsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder**: The encoder in SegNet is a series of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, which reduce the spatial dimensions of the input while increasing the depth of the feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{encoder}}(x) = \\text{Conv}_n(\\text{MaxPool}_{n-1}(...\\text{MaxPool}_1(\\text{Conv}_1(x))...))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where each \\( \\text{Conv}_i \\) represents a convolutional layer with ReLU activation, and \\( \\text{MaxPool}_i \\) represents a max-pooling operation. Importantly, SegNet saves the indices of the maximum values during max-pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decoder**: The decoder upsamples the feature maps back to the original input resolution. Unlike U-Net, SegNet uses the saved max-pooling indices to perform non-learned upsampling, which is then followed by convolutional layers to refine the upsampled features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f_{\\text{decoder}}(x) = \\text{Conv}_1(\\text{Unpool}_1(\\text{Conv}_n(\\text{Unpool}_{n-1}(...))))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( \\text{Unpool}_i \\) represents the unpooling operation using the max-pooling indices, and \\( \\text{Conv}_i \\) represents the convolutional layers that refine the upsampled features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Convolution**: The final convolutional layer produces the pixel-wise class predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Output} = \\text{Conv}_{\\text{final}}(f_{\\text{decoder}}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to other segmentation networks, SegNet typically uses a pixel-wise loss function, such as the categorical cross-entropy loss or the Dice coefficient loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CCE}} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{ic} \\log(p_{ic})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_{ic} \\) is the ground truth label for class \\( c \\), \\( p_{ic} \\) is the predicted probability for class \\( c \\), and \\( C \\) is the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dice Coefficient Loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Dice}} = 1 - \\frac{2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i y_i + \\epsilon}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i + \\epsilon}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_i \\) is the ground truth label, \\( p_i \\) is the predicted probability, and \\( \\epsilon \\) is a small constant to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a SegNet model involves minimizing the chosen loss function using backpropagation and gradient descent, updating the weights of the network to improve segmentation accuracy. The use of max-pooling indices allows SegNet to be both efficient and effective, particularly in real-time applications.\n"
