    "## History of Faster R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster R-CNN was introduced by Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross B. Girshick, and Jian Sun in 2015 in the paper \"Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks.\" Faster R-CNN is the successor to Fast R-CNN and R-CNN, and it represents a significant advancement in object detection. Unlike its predecessors, Faster R-CNN integrates a Region Proposal Network (RPN) directly into the detection pipeline, allowing for the generation of region proposals on the fly during training and...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of Faster R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Faster R-CNN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster R-CNN consists of two main components: the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and the Fast R-CNN detector. The RPN generates region proposals, and the Fast R-CNN detector classifies these proposals and refines their bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: The RPN is a fully convolutional network that takes the feature map produced by a backbone network (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) as input and outputs a set of region proposals. The RPN uses a sliding window approach to generate proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{RPN}(F) = \\{(p_{i}, t_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{k}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( F \\) is the feature map, \\( p_{i} \\) are the objectness scores, and \\( t_{i} \\) are the bounding box coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Anchor Boxes**: The RPN uses anchor boxes, which are predefined boxes of different scales and aspect ratios centered at each sliding window location. These anchors are used as references to generate region proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Anchors} = \\{a_{j}^{s,r}\\}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( s \\) and \\( r \\) represent the scale and aspect ratio of the anchor, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Objectness Score and Bounding Box Regression**: The RPN outputs two types of predictions for each anchor box: an objectness score (indicating the likelihood of the box containing an object) and bounding box regression offsets (to refine the anchor box).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "p_{i} = \\text{sigmoid}(w_{i}^{\\top}F)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "t_{i} = w_{i}^{\\top}F\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( p_{i} \\) is the objectness score and \\( t_{i} \\) is the bounding box offset for anchor \\( i \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fast R-CNN Detector**: The proposals generated by the RPN are fed into the Fast R-CNN detector, which classifies the proposals into object categories and further refines their bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Classifier} = \\text{softmax}(W_{cls} F_{roi})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Bounding Box Regressor} = W_{reg} F_{roi}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( F_{roi} \\) is the feature map for the region of interest (RoI) obtained via RoI pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function of Faster R-CNN is composed of two parts: the RPN loss and the Fast R-CNN loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RPN Loss**: The RPN loss is a combination of the objectness score loss (binary cross-entropy) and the bounding box regression loss (smooth L1 loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{RPN}} = \\frac{1}{N_{cls}} \\sum_{i} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cls}}(p_{i}, p_{i}^{*}) + \\lambda \\frac{1}{N_{reg}} \\sum_{i} p_{i}^{*} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{reg}}(t_{i}, t_{i}^{*})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( p_{i}^{*} \\) is the ground truth label for anchor \\( i \\), and \\( t_{i}^{*} \\) is the ground truth bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fast R-CNN Loss**: The Fast R-CNN loss is similar to the RPN loss but includes a multi-class classification loss instead of a binary classification loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Fast R-CNN}} = \\frac{1}{N_{cls}} \\sum_{i} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cls}}(p_{i}, p_{i}^{*}) + \\lambda \\frac{1}{N_{reg}} \\sum_{i} p_{i}^{*} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{reg}}(t_{i}, t_{i}^{*})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Faster R-CNN involves alternating between training the RPN and the Fast R-CNN detector. The RPN is trained to generate high-quality region proposals, and the Fast R-CNN detector is trained to accurately classify these proposals and refine their bounding boxes.\n"
