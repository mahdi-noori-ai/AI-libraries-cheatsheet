    "\n",
    "Inception-V3 was introduced by Christian Szegedy et al. in the paper \"Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision\" in 2015. It is the third version of the Inception architecture, which was first introduced as GoogLeNet (Inception-V1) in 2014. The Inception series was designed to improve the efficiency of deep convolutional networks by reducing the number of parameters and computational cost. Inception-V3 introduced several innovations, including factorized convolutions, the use of batch no...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of Inception-V3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inception Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The core component of the Inception architecture is the Inception module, which allows the network to capture multi-scale information by applying multiple convolution filters of different sizes (e.g., 1x1, 3x3, 5x5) in parallel. These filters are then concatenated to form the output of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Inception}(x) = [\\text{Conv}_{1x1}(x), \\text{Conv}_{3x3}(x), \\text{Conv}_{5x5}(x), \\text{MaxPool}_{3x3}(x)]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( x \\) is the input feature map, and the convolution and pooling operations are applied in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factorized Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Inception-V3 introduced the concept of factorized convolutions to reduce the computational cost. A 3x3 convolution is factorized into two 1x3 and 3x1 convolutions, which reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the receptive field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Conv}_{3x3}(x) \\approx \\text{Conv}_{1x3}(\\text{Conv}_{3x1}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This factorization reduces the number of parameters and speeds up the network without sacrificing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auxiliary Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Inception-V3 uses an auxiliary classifier to improve convergence during training. The auxiliary classifier is a smaller network attached to an intermediate layer that provides additional supervision and helps in gradient flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{aux}} = \\text{softmax}(W_{\\text{aux}} \\cdot x_{\\text{aux}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( W_{\\text{aux}} \\) are the weights of the auxiliary classifier, and \\( x_{\\text{aux}} \\) is the feature map from the intermediate layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Inception-V3 typically uses the cross-entropy loss function for classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}} = -\\sum_i y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_i \\) is the ground truth label and \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted probability for class \\( i \\). The total loss is a combination of the main classifier loss and the auxiliary classifier loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}} + \\lambda \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{aux}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Inception-V3 is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants, such as Adam. The combination of multi-scale processing, factorized convolutions, and auxiliary supervision allows Inception-V3 to achieve high accuracy with reduced computational cost.\n"
