    "## History of Mask R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Mask R-CNN was introduced by Kaiming He, Georgia Gkioxari, Piotr Doll√°r, and Ross B. Girshick in 2017 in the paper \"Mask R-CNN.\" It is an extension of Faster R-CNN that adds a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI), in parallel with the existing branch for classification and bounding box regression. Mask R-CNN quickly became one of the most popular models for instance segmentation due to its high accuracy and flexibility. It has been widely used in various applications, ...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of Mask R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mask R-CNN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Mask R-CNN extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch that outputs a binary mask for each Region of Interest (RoI). The overall architecture of Mask R-CNN consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backbone Network**: The backbone network (e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt) is used to extract feature maps from the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "F = \\text{Backbone}(I)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( I \\) is the input image and \\( F \\) is the feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: The RPN is a fully convolutional network that generates region proposals from the feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{RPN}(F) = \\{(p_i, t_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( p_i \\) are the objectness scores and \\( t_i \\) are the bounding box coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RoI Align**: Unlike Faster R-CNN, which uses RoI Pooling, Mask R-CNN uses RoI Align, which preserves spatial alignment between the input and the output by avoiding quantization during the pooling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "F_{\\text{roi}} = \\text{RoIAlign}(F, \\text{Proposals})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Classification and Bounding Box Regression**: The RoIs are classified into object categories, and the bounding box coordinates are refined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Class Scores}, \\text{BBox Offsets} = \\text{Classifier}(F_{\\text{roi}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mask Branch**: A parallel branch is added to predict a binary mask for each RoI. The mask branch consists of several convolutional layers that output a binary mask of fixed size (e.g., 28x28).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "M = \\text{MaskBranch}(F_{\\text{roi}})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( M \\) is the predicted binary mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function of Mask R-CNN consists of three components: the classification loss, the bounding box regression loss, and the mask loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification Loss**: The classification loss is a standard categorical cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cls}} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i} \\log(p_i^{*})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( p_i^{*} \\) is the ground truth class label for RoI \\( i \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bounding Box Regression Loss**: The bounding box regression loss is a smooth L1 loss, similar to Faster R-CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{bbox}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i} \\text{smooth}_{L1}(t_i, t_i^{*})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( t_i^{*} \\) is the ground truth bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mask Loss**: The mask loss is a pixel-wise binary cross-entropy loss, computed only on the positive RoIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{mask}} = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\left[ y_{ij} \\log(p_{ij}) + (1 - y_{ij}) \\log(1 - p_{ij}) \\right]\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_{ij} \\) is the ground truth binary mask for pixel \\( j \\) of RoI \\( i \\), and \\( p_{ij} \\) is the predicted probability for the same pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Mask R-CNN involves minimizing the overall loss function, which is the sum of the classification loss, bounding box regression loss, and mask loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{cls}} + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{bbox}} + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{mask}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), with the goal of accurately predicting object classes, bounding boxes, and instance masks.\n"
