    "\n",
    "DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network) was introduced by Gao Huang et al. in the paper \"Densely Connected Convolutional Networks\" in 2017. DenseNet-121 is one of the variants of DenseNet, where the number 121 indicates the total number of layers. DenseNets were designed to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem by using dense connections between layers. Each layer in DenseNet receives input from all previous layers and passes its output to all subsequent layers, promoting feature reuse and improving g...\n"

    "## Mathematical Foundation of DenseNet-121\n",
    "\n",
    "### DenseNet Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovation of DenseNet is the dense connectivity pattern, where each layer receives inputs from all preceding layers and passes its output to all subsequent layers. This connection pattern is formalized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "x_l = H_l([x_0, x_1, ..., x_{l-1}])\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( x_l \\) is the output of the \\( l \\)-th layer, and \\( H_l \\) represents the operation (convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU) applied at the \\( l \\)-th layer. The concatenation of all previous layers is denoted by \\( [x_0, x_1, ..., x_{l-1}] \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dense Block\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet is composed of multiple dense blocks, each of which contains several densely connected layers. The layers within a dense block are connected to each other, ensuring efficient feature reuse. The number of filters in each dense block is controlled by the **growth rate** \\( k \\), which defines the number of feature maps added at each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "k = \\text{growth rate}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output of a dense block is a concatenation of all intermediate outputs within the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Between two dense blocks, transition layers are introduced to downsample the feature maps. A transition layer consists of a 1x1 convolution followed by a 2x2 average pooling layer, which reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(x) = \\text{Pooling}(\\text{Conv}(x))\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bottleneck Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet-121 uses bottleneck layers, where a 1x1 convolution is applied before each 3x3 convolution to reduce the number of feature maps, improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet-121 typically uses the cross-entropy loss function for classification tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{CE}} = -\\sum_i y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( y_i \\) is the ground truth label and \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted probability for class \\( i \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "\n",
    "DenseNet-121 is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants, such as Adam. The dense connections promote better gradient flow, allowing for faster convergence and improved accuracy in deep networks.\n"
